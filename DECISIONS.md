# Decisions log

Running log of judgement calls made during the autonomous CMS/booking build, newest last.

## Baseline

- **`RefreshDatabase` on the base `TestCase`** — the Instructor feature broke the example
  feature test because the in-memory SQLite test database had no migrations. Every feature
  test in this project will need a migrated database, so the trait lives on `Tests\TestCase`
  rather than being repeated per test class.
- **Instructor work committed as the starting point** — the previous session left the
  Instructor model/resource and the dynamic "Meet the team" section uncommitted. Verified
  green and committed as the baseline before starting Phase 1.

## Phase 1 — Content CMS

- **No spatie/laravel-medialibrary** — the established Instructor pattern stores plain
  public-disk paths via Filament `FileUpload`, and most images live in settings groups
  (no model to attach media to). One consistent image approach beats two; medialibrary
  would have added a second convention plus a Filament-v5 plugin compatibility risk.
  Images store either a bundled path ("/images/x.jpg", seeded) or an uploaded
  public-disk path; accessors/`imageUrl()` resolve both.
- **Hand-rolled Filament settings pages** — `App\Filament\Pages\Settings\SettingsPage`
  base class instead of the spatie settings Filament plugin (v5 compatibility unverified).
  One admin page per public page; spatie/laravel-settings underneath with
  `SETTINGS_CACHE_ENABLED=true` (busts on save automatically).
- **Settings array props use `@phpstan-var` only** — spatie's docblock reflector throws
  on `@var array` and array shapes; `@phpstan-var` is invisible to it (= "no cast",
  correct for plain arrays) while keeping Larastan level 6 typing.
- **No FAQs resource** — the design has no FAQ section anywhere, so none was invented.
  The Instagram grid became the GalleryImage resource (the only gallery in the design).
- **Testimonials: `quote` + optional `excerpt`** — the home page shows shortened
  versions of two quotes; `excerpt` (nullable) preserves that pixel-exactly with a
  `home_quote` fallback accessor, instead of duplicating testimonial records.
- **Trust badges live in GeneralSettings** — the four trust cards are shared by the
  home and AFF pages, so they belong to a shared group, not a page group.
- **Product-priced content deferred to Phase 2** — home services cards, tandem pricing
  table + weight charges, AFF price cards stay hardcoded until the Product model exists,
  so each is extracted exactly once. Pay-card/enquiry blocks wait for Phases 3–4.
- **Coached "From £60 per session" eyebrow is plain editable text** — it mentions a
  price but is marketing copy; it will not auto-update when coaching product pricing
  changes. Admin edits it on the Coached page settings screen.
- **Legal pages store HTML** — seeded with the exact current markup (including the
  `mt-4` classes) so the first render is byte-identical; later edits via RichEditor
  may normalise the markup, which is acceptable for owner-edited legal copy.
- **Image uploads in settings/edit forms are "keep current when empty"** — FileUpload
  fields dehydrate only when filled, so saving a form without re-uploading never wipes
  a seeded bundled-path image.
