# Decisions log

Running log of judgement calls made during the autonomous CMS/booking build, newest last.

## Baseline

- **`RefreshDatabase` on the base `TestCase`** — the Instructor feature broke the example
  feature test because the in-memory SQLite test database had no migrations. Every feature
  test in this project will need a migrated database, so the trait lives on `Tests\TestCase`
  rather than being repeated per test class.
- **Instructor work committed as the starting point** — the previous session left the
  Instructor model/resource and the dynamic "Meet the team" section uncommitted. Verified
  green and committed as the baseline before starting Phase 1.
